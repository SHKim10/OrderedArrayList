# OrderedArrayList
Discussion:
1. To find the index in OrderedArrayList (Part II.2) we can use a loop to find the first value larger than the one we are looking for.
2. We discussed potential private helper methods to help us find the correct index.
3. We can handle overriding both add methods by calling the regular add method, but ignoring the index.
